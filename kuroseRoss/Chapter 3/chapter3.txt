+  0101 0011
+  0110 0110
+  0111 0100
---------------------------- (8bit limit wrap around)
 1 0010 1101
   0010 1110
1s complement -------------- (+ 1111 1111)
   1101 0001

You use 1s compliment in order to get the value necessary for 3 words and checksum to equal 1111 1111.
So if you later add together 3 words and a checksum and the result is not 1111 1111 then you know you have
an error.

This scheme detects 1 bit errors but doesn't necessarily detect 2 bit ones. 2 bit error can still result in
the same sum of 1111 1111. For example when 1 bit error occurs in 2 different words but in the same position.

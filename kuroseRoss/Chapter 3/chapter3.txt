+  0101 0011
+  0110 0110
+  0111 0100
---------------------------- (8bit limit wrap around)
 1 0010 1101
   0010 1110
1s complement -------------- (+ 1111 1111)
   1101 0001

You use 1s compliment in order to get the value necessary for 3 words and checksum to equal 1111 1111.
So if you later add together 3 words and a checksum and the result is not 1111 1111 then you know you have
an error.

This scheme detects 1 bit errors but doesn't necessarily detect 2 bit ones. 2 bit error can still result in
the same sum of 1111 1111. For example when 1 bit error occurs in 2 different words but in the same position.

-----------------
10001111 11111111

Segment is considered incorrectly received since it doesn't result in 16bit of 1s.
Since it is a UDP segment the receiver still passes it. UDP doesn't do error recovery by itself.

P5

No. Errors might have occurred in multiple parts and that might correspond to each-other. This way checksum
calculation would still result in false-positive.

P13

With built in UDP no. You would need to modify the protocol to keep track of the received packets.

P14

It would work over channel with bit errors since due to uncorruptable negative acknowledgments. If there is an
error you can always request a retransmit. With a lossy network the negative acknowledgment might get lost or the
packet might itself never arrive thus there is nothing to negatively acknowledge.
